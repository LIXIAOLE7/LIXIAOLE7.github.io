I am currently a first year Ph.D. student in the [School of Data Science](https://www.sdsc.cityu.edu.hk/) at CityU, under the supervision of [Dr. LI Jizhou](http://jizhou.li/).I received my Master's degree from the same institution. Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Nuclear Physics from Lanzhou University (LZU).

My research interests lie in deep learning and computational imaging, with a particular focus on electron/optical microscopy image processing.
